# minikube Provider

A terraform provider for [minikube!](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

## Installing your preferred driver

If you don't have minikube installed, or have never run minikube before, you'll need to install your corresponding driver first

This requires _admin_ permissions

### Minikube

```bash
minikube --vm=true --driver=hyperkit --download-only
minikube --driver=docker --download-only
```

### Manual

You can find the drivers published in the [minikube releases section](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases). Simply download the 
preferred driver and copy it to your .minikube/bin folder and ensure the current user has sufficient access

### Living dangerously

```bash
#x85_64
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scott-the-programmer/terraform-provider-minikube/main/bootstrap/install-driver.sh | sudo bash -s "kvm1"

#arm63
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scott-the-programmer/terraform-provider-minikube/main/bootstrap/install-driver.sh | sudo bash -s "kvm1" "arm64"
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "minikube" {}
```
